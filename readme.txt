Print Customized Barcode Labels Effortlessly

== Description ==

We decided to create Barcode Man because we could not find a barcode printing solution that was both customizable and easy to use.

This inspired us to create Barcode Man --  an effective way to create barcodes and labels for your products.

A solution that caters to your wider needs and preferences.

= How does Barcode Man work? =

Barcode Man allows you to create highly customizable labels in various formats.

Above all, we provide you with a solution that will enable you to create labels easily.

Some of the advantages of using Barcode Man include:

- An easy-to-use drag and drop editor that gives you an endless amount of customizability.
- A straightforward printing process allowing you to print out barcodes quickly
- The ability to rotate and resize any of your premade label elements.
- The editor allows you to be as precise as you want by enabling you to resize each individual element of the barcode label (SKU / Name / Variant / Price / Custom Text (Logo) / image / QRcode and more.)
